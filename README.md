# Team: TBD - Changes

# Project Title: Where’s Spot?
I love PUps
# Team Members: Brian Sedely, Eugene Khom, Faviana Lopez

# Project Description: 
A meetup app for dog owners to find other dog owners based on compatible profiles.

# Sketch of Final Product:
A dog owner will build a profile for themselves as owner and for each of their dogs. They will then list characteristics and which kinds of dogs their dogs would like to play with. App users (the dog owners) will have the ability to geolocate other dog owners and also see a map of dog parks based on their location. The app users will be able to communicate with other app users to see if they would like to meet up with their dogs.

# APIs to be Used:
Google Geolocation
Google Maps
Currently researching a few other potential leads for add’l API’s that have dog-friendly locations (besides “dog park” proper… e.g. a state park that allows dogs), but at a minimum the two above.

# Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
Design UI using HTML/CSS/Bootstrap or another framework, e.g. materialize
Make a Firebase DB for owners with associated dog profiles
Design the profile characteristics for owners and also profiles for their dogs (such as breed, size, temperament, and a set of characteristics that your dogs are or are not compatible with).
Create ability to see characteristics of other app users’ dogs to aid in deciding which users you would like to have your dogs play with
Create Firebase DB chat or messaging ability in app
Deploy to Gitpages
Test and debug

# BONUS Ideas:
Have a history or log of meetups
Have rankings awarded to users based on frequency of use, confirmed by both users when they meet up
Have the ability to rate app users… self-regulate for “bad actors”
